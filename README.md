## Introduction

Crimpy is a Python package for interactive mapping and visualizing areas of interest. Crimpy is built upon several open-source packages, including: [folium](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium), [ipyleaflet](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet), [ipywidgets](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets), and [geopandas](https://github.com/geopandas/geopandas). This package was built with rock climbers in mind. Crimpy can be used to visualize potential climbs you are wanting/planning on completing. You can do so by getting coordinates of the climbs you are wanting to do and compiling them into a list. There is another option for getting the coordinates and this is by using Mountain Project. On Mountain Project you can select specific climbs/routes at your desired location and then export those you have selected as a CSV file which can be uploaded and visualized using Crimpy.
